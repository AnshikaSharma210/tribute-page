                <p class="para1">M.S. Dhoni or <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong>, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar
                    [now Jharkhand]),is an Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century
                    culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in
                    2011.</p><br>

                <p class="para2">Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. Dhoni took over the captaincy of the
                    one-day side in 2007 and led India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia and
                    Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test
                    rankings for the first time in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day
                    International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s
                    dashing innings of 91 not out—in front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory
                    over Sri Lanka in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of the 2015
                    Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain in 2017, having led his country in 331
                    international matches, the most for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired
                    from international competition.</p>
